# my_blockchain

my_blockchain is a project where I create a lite version of a blockchain. Throughout this project, not only did I learn what blockchain was and how it works,
but I became much more familiar with using linked lists. Specifically using double pointers to pass them around and modify them. Through the beginning and
middle stages of this project, I made lots of mistakes and was confused as to why my nodes weren't getting modified properly. Towards the end I began feeling
far more comfortable using the double pointers to access and iterate through the lists.
